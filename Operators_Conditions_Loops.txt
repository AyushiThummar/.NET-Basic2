➡️ Operators :-

→ Unary Operator : Works with one operand (Ex., ++x, --y, -a).

→ Binary Operator : Works with two operands (Ex., a + b, x * y).

→ Ternary Operator : A shortcut for if-else : condition ? true : false.


➡️ Arithmetic Operators :-

→ Used to perform math operations like +, -, *, /, %.


➡️ Relational / Comparison Operators :-

→ Compare two values, return true/false : ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=.


➡️ Logical Operators :-

→ Combine multiple conditions : 	&& (AND) : All true
							|| (OR) : Any one true
							! (NOT) : Reverses condition



➡️ Decision Making Statements :-

→ Simple if : Runs code if condition is true.

→ if...else : Runs one block if true, another if false.

→ Nested if : if inside another if for multiple levels of conditions.

→ Ladder if (if...else if) : Checks multiple conditions in order.

→ switch...case : Selects code to run based on matching case value.


➡️ Looping Statements :-

→ while : Repeats code while condition is true (entry check).

→ do...while : Runs code at least once, then checks condition (exit check).

→ for : Loops with initialization, condition, and increment in one line.

→ foreach : Loops through each item in an array or collection.
